{"country":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","description":"Although the DRC (among other Central African countries) top the world in frequency of fires, the nature of these fires are generally less devastating than the fires experienced by their South American counterparts, which may be a reason they haven’t garnered as much media attention. The majority of the recorded fires in Central Africa are a result of 'slash and burn' agricultural practices. Fires are mostly in dry forests and savanna areas, which are unlikely to spread through rain forests. Farmers usually set their land aflame before the rainy season hits. Because DRC lies on the equator, its northern area experiences rainy season from April to November, and its southern area from October to May. Subsequently, fires tend to appear most frequently between January and March in the north and between July and September in the South. Although they are not as damaging as burning rain forests, these fires still reflect an unsustainable land management practice that can bring significant environmental harm through processes such as deforestation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss as well as increased risks to large forest fires."},
{"country":"Australia","description":"Although Australia has been known to experience regular bush fires, fire conditions this year have been unusually concerning. Not only did bushfires start burning early in the year, the total areas burned are soaring above the nation’s average. Fires this year differ from the past in alarming ways. In past years, big fires were largely attributed to above average rainfall that produced more fuel in outback grasslands in the west. By contrast, large fires this year are connected to droughts that have produced more dry fuel leading to fires burning in unusual places. As a result, raging fires from this year have been causing concern for rare species. For example, the population of the northern long-nosed potoroo has been decimated after a fire burned down a preserve in New South Wales where the potoroos feed on truffles that grow on gum tree roots. Moreover, nearly 8000 koalas have lost their lives to the bush fires as well."},
{"country":"Bolivia","description":"Bolivia’s rank in number of fires spiked in 2010, which is likely due to the eruption of over 25,000 fires that burned across 15,000 square kilometers and led the Bolivian government to declare a state of emergency. Most of these fires were caused by farmers clearing their lands with controlled burns that went out of control with high winds and dry lands. Earlier this year (2019), Bolivia experienced the worst fire in two decades as fires raged in their Amazon rain forest for over two months and charred more than 4 million hectares of land. The fires started to spread uncontrollably in August, one month after Bolivian president Evo Morales passed legislation that encouraged slash and burn farming to clear lands."},
{"country":"Iceland","description":"The high number of fire activity in Iceland in 2014 is likely a result of the eruption of the Bárðarbunga volcano in August of that year, the second largest volcanic eruption in recorded history and largest in 230 years. The volcanic activity lasted for over 180 days, producing enough lava to cover an area the size of Manhatten."},
{"country":"United States","description":"Although the total number of wildfires in the U.S. has dropped over the past decade, the total areas burned have actually been increasing gradually. Most notably, wildfire activity in the western U.S. has become more widespread and intensive, largely due to changing climate conditions. California, in particular, experienced three straight years of record-breaking fires in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Over 2.7 million people in California live in areas classified as 'very high fire hazard severity zones.'"},
{"country":"Brazil","description":"Brazil’s saw a soar in the number of fires this year with the large flames in the Amazon rain forest. Natural fires are extremely rare in the Amazon, so almost all the fires burning in the rain forest are likely started by humans. Many trees in the Amazon are cleared to plant soy or for creating cattle pastures, and the ‘slash and burn’ method is commonly used to clear trees quickly. Moreover, fires lead to deforestation, which fuels forest loss, making the region drier and leading to even more deforestation. And since much of the rain in the Amazon is generated by the rainforest itself, fewer trees lead to drier climate which leads to more fires. In the previous years wildfires were often related to the lack of rain, but it has been quite moist this year (2019). Brazilian farmers declared a 'fire day' in August and coordinated a massive burnout of pastures and degraded forests. Farmers felt encouraged to take this action because the president has signaled his willingness to open up previously protected land. Bolsonaro has also cut funds from the national agency that protects indigenous peoples (FUNAI) and the environmental protection agency (IBAMA), as well as dismissed the director of INPE (national spatial institute which was tracking deforestation) as producing fake data."},
{"country":"Indonesia","description":"This year (2019), fires in Indonesia has burnt close to 4 million acres of land, leading to the spread of smoky haze over Southeast Asia and raising health concerns. This year's fire situation was the worst since 2015 when more than 6 million acres were burned. The fires in Indonesia are often started by small farmers or palm oil growers who clear land using slash-and-burn methods, and in recent decades large corporations have industrialized this practice. These fires often spread rapidly, in particular during dry weather. However, Indonesia has taken countermeasures since the last major fire / haze event in 2015, which has helped limit this year's disaster."},
{"country":"Sweden","description":"The peak in 2018 is associated with the large number of wildfires that occurred throughout much of the country during the summer of 2018.  Sweden experienced an unusually long heatwave and had a particularly dry summer, and many smaller incidents such as disposable BBQs and lighting strikes have sparked the spread of wildfires during this dry and hot period."},
{"country":"Eritrea","description":"In 2011, the eruption of Nabro, which lies in a belt of active volcanoes that follows the Red Sea in Southern Eritrea, has created concentrated SO2 plumes and dropped ash over extensive areas. Meanwhile, the conflict between Eritrea and Ethopia, which officially ended in 2018, could potentially also be the cause of some fires."},
{"country":"Russia","description":"The year of 2019 has seen a dramatic increase in wildfires in some arctic regions that normally rarely burn, raising fears that climate change is exacerbating the situation as hotter, drier conditions lead to more fires.  Between July and September this year (2019), fire has burned about six million acres of Siberian forest. The 2010 Russian wildfires involved hundreds of wildfires that broke out across Russia, mostly in the west part during the summer of 2010. The fires were associated with record-high temperatures that were attributed to climate change. In 2012 there was a peak of fire counts as forests and bog land in far eastern Russia were burning from June to August, with that summer being one of the hottest on record for Siberia, reaching an average of 33.5 degrees Celsius."},
{"country":"Portugal","description":"Portugal faces fires every summer, but poor forest management and changing climatic conditions are making the country increasingly vulnerable to fires. In addition, abandonment of rural landscapes lead to fast-growing trees crowding against tall grasses and shrubs, a highly flammable landscape in the summer heat. Furthermore, Many Portuguese forest landscapes consist of large numbers of pioneer species such as pine and eucalyptus trees, which are prone to combustion, and large continuous swaths of forests without gaps in vegetation increases risks fires spreading."},
{"country":"Kazakhstan","description":"This land-locked country has an extremely continental climate. The North of the country is characterized by cold,long winters and dry, short summers, while the South is characterized by short and light-snow winters and long, dry and hot summers. The dry hot summer begins in the end of May and lasts till mid September, with temperatures sometimes going up to 35 - 40 Celsius.  Summer droughts can often be accompanied by dusty storms and dry winds. During drought periods, the fire danger increases greatly and the number of wildfires occurring on wooded land is extremely high.  Fires in Kazakhstan usually occur in the early spring and in autumn, particularly during drier years, with causes often being agricultural burning or violation of the requirements of fire safety.  The steppe landscape makes up over 10% of Kazakhstan’s land area, and the phytomass in this ecosystem becomes a dangerous fuel after dry periods, and fires here can last for long time and spread over large areas.  The climate of Kazakhstan has been observed to becoming more arid over the last 50 years, which is a trend that can be associated with an increase in potential for wildfires."},
{"country":"Syria","description":"Crop fires are not uncommon in Syria, but there were an unprecedented number of them in the country this year. Over 47,000 hectares of wheat and barley crops have been destroyed in flames. Due to the intensity of fires, many Kurdish farmers suspect that they have been started on purpose by their enemies – the defeated Islamic state militants, who might be seeking revenge; the Turkish government, who is at war with the Kurds; or the Syrian government, who is trying to weaken the Kurds. Additionally, wildfires have been raging across forests in Syria and Lebanon due to dry weather, high temperatures and high winds."},
